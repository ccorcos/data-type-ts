- is the goal here to define typescript data types with this thing?
- or is our goal to conform to the defined type? I suppose we can go both ways.


whats left?
-[x] undefined
-[x] null
-[x] string
-[x] number
-[x] boolean
-[x] literal

// Make sure the both infer and conform.
-[x] array
-[x] tuple
-[x] map
-[x] object
-[x] any
-[x] union

- later on, we could being back schema serialization. totally possible.


- Codegen runtime validators.
	- imported types?
- better map type -- string | number | union as keys...
- intersection types?

// File paths
// const sourceFilePath = path("src/shared/schemaInput.ts")
// const outputFilePath = path("src/shared/schemaOutput.ts")
